Project no: 6

Project description: Implemented a god mode, reset button, and music/sounds.
Also, included an end game. The game ends when either the player snail or the
opponent snail reaches the white flag at the top of the obstacle course. 

Some pizzazz that I've added is a pause menu which is pulled up with the "P" 
key, a timer that'll keep track of how long the race is, and a high score 
tracker that writes the best time to an xml. I drew all the assets in the
game. The new assets that I've drawn are the flag and the snail arrow for 
the pause menu.

The easiest part of this project: Besides writing the README file, creating 
the god mode was the easiest part.

Problems that I had in completing this project: It was difficult to get the
opponent snail to go through the entire obstacle course. Even though I hard
coded the path, it was difficult to get right with all the jumps and turns.
