Project Description:
	A 2D Platformer game where you play as a snail and race against an
enemy snail to the finish flag. 
You can see a video of game play here: https://youtu.be/xmlyduJ41yw

	This was created in a C++ engine with SDL. It uses object pooling
for the projectiles. It uses data-driven code with an XML file so I can
change values, such as movement speed, without recompiling. I also 
implemented the observer pattern to alert the enemy snail of the player's
position. 

How To Run:
Have SDL 2.0 installed on your machine. You also need SDL mixer for the
sound. The Clemson lab machines should already have them installed.
	Type "make" to compile the program.
	Type "./run" to run the program.
	Press "Esc" or close out to quit the program. 
	Type "make clean" to get rid of the object files.

How To Play/Controls:
	Get to the white finish flag before your opponent!

	* W - jump
	* Space Bar - shoot / select (in pause menu)
	* P - pause
	* Esc - quit

	* G - god mode (you're invincible)
